# Google Homepage project

https://zirafnik.github.io/google-homepage/

This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of the project is to make a visual clone of the google homepage.

I believe I managed to create a pixel perfect copy of the current design. All the links and images also have correct decorations.

To get the correct colors and some other values, I used the developer inspection tool. This proved to be about all the assistance I could get with it, since the whole original code has been Minified and is very hard to follow.

The project went quite smoothly, the only thing I struggled a bit with, was the search-icon in the text input. I managed to get it right, with relative positioning. I also then used relative positioning to move the text in input form.

I also learned how to make links look a different way, depending on what is happening with them and that you can pair that with classes and ids.

All other positioning was done with flexbox, padding and margins.
